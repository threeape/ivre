Fast install & first run
========================

This file describes the steps to install IVRE, run the first scans and
add the results to the database with all components (scanner, web
server, database server) on the same (Debian or Ubuntu) machine.

Please note that, depending on your distribution, the versions of some
software packages might not be recent enough, particularly for MongoDB
(version 2.6 minimum) and pymongo (version 2.7.2 minimum). If that's
the case, you will have to install those programs on you own,
referring to their documentation (see `MongoDB on Debian
<http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-debian/>`__
or `MongoDB on Ubuntu
<http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/>`__
and `pymongo <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymongo/>`__), instead of
``apt-get``-ting them.

You might also want to adapt it to your needs, architecture, etc.

For another way to run IVRE easily (probably even more easily), see
:ref:`install/docker:Docker`.

Install
-------

::

   $ sudo apt-get -y install mongodb python-pymongo python-crypto \
   >   python-future python-bottle apache2 libapache2-mod-wsgi dokuwiki
   $ git clone https://github.com/ivre/ivre
   $ cd ivre
   $ python setup.py build
   $ sudo python setup.py install

Setup
-----

::

   $ sudo -s
   # cd /var/www/html ## or depending on your version /var/www
   # rm index.html
   # ln -s /usr/local/share/ivre/web/static/* .
   # cd /var/lib/dokuwiki/data/pages
   # ln -s /usr/local/share/ivre/dokuwiki/doc
   # cd /var/lib/dokuwiki/data/media
   # ln -s /usr/local/share/ivre/dokuwiki/media/logo.png
   # ln -s /usr/local/share/ivre/dokuwiki/media/doc
   # cd /usr/share/dokuwiki
   # patch -p0 < /usr/local/share/ivre/dokuwiki/backlinks.patch
   # cd /etc/apache2/mods-enabled
   # for m in rewrite.load wsgi.conf wsgi.load ; do
   >   [ -L $m ] || ln -s ../mods-available/$m ; done
   # cd ../
   # echo 'Alias /cgi "/usr/local/share/ivre/web/wsgi/app.wsgi"' > conf-enabled/ivre.conf
   # echo '<Location /cgi>' >> conf-enabled/ivre.conf
   # echo 'SetHandler wsgi-script' >> conf-enabled/ivre.conf
   # echo 'Options +ExecCGI' >> conf-enabled/ivre.conf
   # echo 'Require all granted' >> conf-enabled/ivre.conf
   # echo '</Location>' >> conf-enabled/ivre.conf
   # sed -i 's/^\(\s*\)#Rewrite/\1Rewrite/' /etc/dokuwiki/apache.conf
   # echo 'WEB_GET_NOTEPAD_PAGES = "localdokuwiki"' >> /etc/ivre.conf
   # service apache2 reload  ## or start
   # exit

Open a web browser and visit `http://localhost/ <http://localhost/>`__.
IVRE Web UI should show up, with no result of course. Click the HELP
button to check if everything works.

Database init, data download & importation
------------------------------------------

::

   $ yes | ivre ipinfo --init
   $ yes | ivre scancli --init
   $ yes | ivre view --init
   $ yes | ivre flowcli --init
   $ yes | sudo ivre runscansagentdb --init
   $ sudo ivre ipdata --download

Run a first scan
----------------

Against 1k (routable) IP addresses, with a single nmap process:

::

   $ sudo ivre runscans --routable --limit 1000

Go have some coffees and/or beers (remember that according to the
traveler's theorem, for any time of the day, there exists a time zone in
which it is OK to drink).

When the command has terminated, import the results and create a view:

::

   $ ivre scan2db -c ROUTABLE,ROUTABLE-CAMPAIGN-001 -s MySource -r \
   >              scans/ROUTABLE/up
   $ ivre db2view nmap

The ``-c`` argument adds categories to the scan results. Categories are
arbitrary names used to filter results. In this example, the values are
``ROUTABLE``, meaning the results came out while scanning the entire
reachable address space (as opposed to while scanning a specific
network, AS or country, for example), and ``ROUTABLE-CAMPAIGN-001``,
which is the name I have chosen to mark this particular scan campaign.

The ``-s`` argument adds a name for the source of the scan. Here again,
it is an arbitrary name you can use to unambiguously specify the network
access used to run the scan. This can be used later to highlight result
differences depending on where the scans are run from.

Go back to the Web UI and browse your first scan results!

Some remarks
------------

There is no tool (for now) to automatically import scan results to the
database. It is your job to do so, according to your settings.

If you run very large scans (particularly against random hosts on the
Internet), do NOT use the default ``--output=XML`` option. Rather, go
for the ``--output=XMLFork``. This will fork one nmap process per IP to
scan, and is (sadly) much more reliable.

Another way to run scans efficiently is to use an `agent <AGENT.md>`__
and the ``ivre runscansagent`` command.
